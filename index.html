            Terroir refers to natural factors in the process of making cheese, such as geography,
            climate, and vegetation. Cheeses made from animals living in mountainous regions might taste more mineral-rich,
            while cheeses made from animals living in pastoral valleys might have a more lush and creamy texture. These
            differences come from the varying lifestyles of animals based on their environment, as well as the minerals and
            nutrients in their diets.

            <h2 class="menu-image-header">Raw Milk</h2>
            While different animals produce different cheeses, what makes French cheese so recognizable is the usage of raw
            milk. Raw milk negates standard pasteurization and heat treatment, which allows for more natural, gut-healthy
            bacteria. This creates the richer and more dynamic flavor that French cheese is famous for. Furthermore, by
            avoiding the pasteurization process, the taste and texture from the terroir is even more noticeable!

            <h2 class="menu-image-header">Cow Milk</h2>
            Cows are the most historically recent type of milk harvested for cheese. They need a relatively open pasture to
            graze, which can result in creamier textures influenced by the open landscape and unique terroir. Cow cheese is
            often less tangy than other cheeses. It contains the highest levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are
            beneficial fats associated with heart health and balancing inflammation.

            <h2 class="menu-image-header">Goat Milk</h2>
            Goats can be raised among mountains and rock formations. Their active lifestyle in these mineral-rich environments
            contributes to the lowest natural fat content of any animal milk used for cheese making. This means that goat
            cheese is the least likely to contribute to cardiovascular risks, and it has potential gut health benefits. Goat
            cheese is especially tangy and has a lower component of lactose.

            <h2 class="menu-image-header">Sheep Milk</h2>
            Sheep milk has the lowest yield but the highest amounts of butterfat and calcium. This high fat content (nearly 
            twice as much as cow milk) and calcium creates a rich texture. It also supports heart health, reduces inflammation,
            and provides quick energy. Sweat is a telltale sign of sheep cheese, as they often glisten at room temperature as
            fat globules change from solid to liquid. If it’s sweaty, it’s ready!
